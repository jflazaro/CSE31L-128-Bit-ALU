Design Report
	Assumptions: Design basic 128 bit ALU in terms of structural design. 128 ALUs will be cascaded. 
Arithmetic block is created with 3 modules: 7to1 mux for arithmetic operations, 7to1 carry generator mux, 1Bit full adder. 
Logic block is created with 2 modules: 5to1 mux for logic operations, 5to1mux carry generator
ALU is created with arithmetic block, logic block, two muxes
